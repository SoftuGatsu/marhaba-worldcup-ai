# Form Submission Fix

## Issue
When users filled out the travel planning form and submitted it, the user's message bubble wasn't appearing in the chat. Instead, users only saw the loading/thinking indicator from the agent.

## Root Cause
The problem was in the `handleFormSubmit` function in `TravelPlanContainer.tsx`. The original flow was:

1. User submits form
2. `setViewMode('chat')` - switches to chat view immediately
3. `sendMessage()` - adds user message and immediately sets `isLoading: true`
4. React renders the chat view with loading state active

The issue was that React state updates are asynchronous, and the loading state was being set too quickly after the view mode change and message addition, causing the typing indicator to appear before the user message bubble had a chance to render properly.

## Solution
Implemented a more robust state management approach using `useEffect` and a pending API call state:

### Key Changes:

1. **Separated State Updates**: Split the process into distinct phases:
   - Add user message to conversation
   - Switch to chat view
   - Set up pending API call
   - Handle API call in `useEffect` after UI has updated

2. **Added Pending API Call State**: 
   ```typescript
   const [pendingApiCall, setPendingApiCall] = useState<{message: string, sessionId: string} | null>(null);
   ```

3. **useEffect for API Handling**: The actual API call is now handled in a `useEffect` that runs after the view mode changes to 'chat' and ensures the UI has rendered:
   ```typescript
   React.useEffect(() => {
     if (pendingApiCall && viewMode === 'chat') {
       // Handle API call with small delay for UI rendering
     }
   }, [pendingApiCall, viewMode, currentConversation?.messages]);
   ```

4. **Proper Timing**: Added a small delay (100ms) before starting the API call to ensure React has finished rendering the chat view and user message.

## Flow After Fix:

1. User submits form
2. User message is added to conversation state
3. View switches to chat mode
4. `pendingApiCall` state is set
5. `useEffect` detects the pending call and chat view
6. Small delay ensures UI rendering is complete
7. Loading state is set and API call begins
8. User sees their message bubble, then the typing indicator

## Benefits:

- User message is always visible before loading starts
- Proper separation of concerns between UI state and API calls
- More predictable rendering behavior
- Better user experience with clear visual feedback
