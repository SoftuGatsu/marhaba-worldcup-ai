## üéØ How to Test Demo Scenarios

1. **Enable Demo Mode**: Set `VITE_DEMO_MODE=true` in your `.env` file
2. **Fill the Form**: Use the recommended values above for your desired scenario
3. **Submit**: The system will automatically match your inputs to the best scenario
4. **Review Response**: You'll get a comprehensive, detailed response for that scenario

## üîÑ Scenario Matching Algorithm

The demo service uses a scoring algorithm that:
- Compares form values with predefined scenario values
- Handles different field types (strings, arrays, booleans)
- Calculates similarity scores for each scenario
- Returns the best matching scenario's response
- Adds a demo mode indicator to the response

## üõ†Ô∏è For Developers

### Adding New Demo Scenarios

To add a new demo scenario, edit `/src/services/demoService.ts`:

```typescript
{
  name: "Your Scenario Name",
  description: "Brief description of the scenario",
  formValues: {
    // Form field values that should trigger this scenario
    destination: "City Name",
    budget: "$X-Y",
    // ... other form fields
  },
  response: {
    messages: [
      {
        type: 'text',
        payload: {
          content: 'Your comprehensive response markdown content...'
        }
      },
      // Optional: Add structured recommendations
      {
        type: 'accommodation_recommendations',
        payload: { /* accommodation data */ }
      },
      {
        type: 'food_recommendations', 
        payload: { /* food data */ }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Demo Mode Detection

Check if demo mode is active:
```typescript
import { demoService } from '@/services/demoService';

if (demoService.isDemoMode()) {
  // Demo mode logic
}
```

### Getting Demo Scenarios

Retrieve all available scenarios:
```typescript
const scenarios = demoService.getDemoScenarios();
console.log('Available demo scenarios:', scenarios);
```

## üìù Notes

- Demo responses are designed to be comprehensive and realistic
- Each scenario includes multiple message types (text, accommodations, food)
- Responses simulate real API delays (2 seconds)
- Form data is analyzed to find the best matching scenario
- If no good match is found, the system defaults to the highest-scoring scenario

## üöÄ Demo Presentation Tips

1. **Start with Form**: Show how different form combinations trigger different scenarios
2. **Highlight Matching**: Explain how the system matches preferences to scenarios  
3. **Compare Scenarios**: Demonstrate the range from budget to luxury options
4. **Show Completeness**: Point out how responses include accommodations, food, activities, etc.
5. **Emphasize Realism**: Note how responses include realistic pricing and detailed itineraries
